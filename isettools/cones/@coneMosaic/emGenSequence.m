function [nTrialsPos, nTrialsPosMicrons] = emGenSequence(obj, ...
    nEyeMovements, varargin)
% Generate sequence of eye movements
%
% Syntax:
%	[nTrialsPos, nTrialsPosMicrons] = emGenSequence(...
%       obj, nEyeMovements, [varargin])
%
% Description:
%    The eye movement samples are created at the same temporal sample rate
%    as the cone integration time. We only update the position at the
%    beginning of each integration time.
%
%    This has some consequences for how we store and retrieve the eye
%    movement parameters. Consider the case of tremor. We need to store the
%    amplitudes of the tremor in a way that permits us to do the
%    calculation correctly no matter what the cone integration time is. The
%    literature specifies that the maximum frequency of tremor is 100 Hz.
%    In that case, the typical sample time between each tremor is 10 ms.
%    The amplitude of the tremor at  100 Hz is about 1 cone width (17e-3
%    radians/sample).
%
%    Our calculations make a best estimate of the eye position at the start
%    of every cone integration period. We assume the eye is fixed
%    throughout the integration period. This approximation makes sense for
%    calculations done at a shorter cone integration time than 10 ms, which
%    is the tremor rate.
%
%    For an example, suppose the update time is 10 ms. We store the
%    amplitude in terms of radians per second, which is (17e-3)/(10 ms) =
%    (17e-1/sec). Thus, when you  look at the amplitude value, it may
%    appear frighteningly large - 17e-1 radians is about 100 cones. But
%    remember this is the amplitude per second. When we calculate the
%    tremor amplitude at the proper update rate, which is 10 ms, the
%    amplitude is 100 times smaller (about 1 cone).
%
%    In normal programming use, such as in this routine, dealing with the
%    units is simplified for you because you can ask for the amplitude in
%    units of cones/sample. This takes into account the tremor parameters
%    as well as the cone integration time. See the code below.
%
%    Reminder! The eye movement model combines the following: tremor,
%    drift, and microsaccades.
%
% Inputs:
%     obj               - cone mosaic object

%                         positions in units of cone positions.
%     nTrialsPosMicrons - nTrials x nEyeMovements x 2 matrix of eye
%                         positions in units of microns.
%
