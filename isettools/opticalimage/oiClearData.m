function oi = oiClearData(oi)
% Clear data from optical image structure
%
% Syntax:
%   oi = oiClearData(oi)
%
% Description:
%    Clear the data from the optical image structure as well as the data in
%    the optics structure within it.  
%
%    Clear the optics data is not necessarily a good idea, as these data
%    are mainly the PSF value.  The optics are treated as a special case in
%    vcImportObject where the default is to preserve the data.  The default
%    is to clear for other objects (sensor, vcimage, and so forth).
%
%    It is also possible to clear the optics data using opticsClearData.
%
% Inputs:
%    oi - Struct. The optical image structure
%
% Outputs:
%    oi - Struct. The modified (cleared) optical image structure
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.
%
% Notes:
%    * (Copied from below) Do we really want to change the topics here?
%      All this does is clear the OTF data.  And there is nothing wrong
%      with that data which is specified by its own wavelength OTF.wave
%      anyway. -- Thoughts?
