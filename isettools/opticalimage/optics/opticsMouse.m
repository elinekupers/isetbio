% Optics for mouse eye
%
% Syntax:
%   optics = opticsMouse(pupilRadius)
%
% Description:
%    Not yet tested or working. Just a placeholder for now.
%
%    Optics calculated for a mouse's eye. This is similar to human optics,
%    with different parameter values.
%
%    There are extensive notes contained in this function. To access the
%    notes type 'edit opticsMouse.m' into the Command Window.
%
% Inputs:
%    pupilRadius - Numeric. The pupil radius in meters.
%
% Outputs:
%    optics      - Structure. The optics structure for the mouse eye.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.

%% NOTES ABOUT FOCAL LENGTH
% Since the mouse optical system is not symmetric, there are two focal
% lengths: front (before the cornea + lens) and back (after the cornea +
% lens, roughly the lens-retina distance).
% 
% Since light travels in air before the optical system, and in vitreous
% humor after, the value for the back focal length should be multiplied by
% the refraction index to be used. We have:
%
%       OpticalPower = 1/focalLength*n_medium
%                    = 1/frontFocalLength*n_air = 1/0.001756*1
%                    = 1/backFocalLength*n_vitreous = 1/0.002347*1.3341
%
% Note: this value of n_vitreous = 1.3341 comes from geometrical
% calculations on the mouse eye. For comparison, the human vitreous humor
% has an index of 1.336.
%
% Therefore, to avoid having to multiply all the geometry by the refraction
% index, we use the front focal length, for which the refraction index is
% 1.0003, approx to 1.
%
% The optical power is wavelength-dependent, which means the focal length
% is too: longer focal length for short wavelengths, shorter focal length
% for long wavelengths. For fLength, we need the focal length at the
% infocus wavelength.
% (DO WE?? TODO: what is the dioptric power of the unaccomodated eye?)
% 
% (i.e. that focuses on the retina surface, or as close to it as possible.)
% At 544nm, we have 0.4 diopters of defocus, which is our best value. (see
% the plot in mouseCore.m for defocus values. By interpolation, the zero
% defocus would be at about 542nm.)
%
% So ***we are using the front focal length at 544nm for fLength value***.

% [Note: XXX - This OTF is a diffraction-limited model, with mouse values
% for defocus. I'm not sure what happens for the chromatic aberration? The

% Another possibility would be to use a diffraction-limited model, with the

% aberration from data (??), and build it all with Zmax. Peter Catrysse
