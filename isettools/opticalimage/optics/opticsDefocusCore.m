function [otf, sampleSFmm] = opticsDefocusCore(optics, sampleSF, D)
% Compute the optical transfer function for dioptric power D0 and defocus D 
%
% Syntax:
%   [otf, sampleSFmm] = opticsDefocusCore(optics, sampleSF, D)
%
% Description:
%    A computation for a defocused OTF.
%
%    Compute the optical transfer function for dioptic power DO and the
%    defocus D. 
%
%    There are examples contained in the code. To access, type 'edit
%    opticsDefocusCore.m' into the Command Window.
%
% Inputs:
%	 optics     - Struct. Optics structure
%    sampleSF   - Vector. Spatial frequencies in cycles/deg
%    D          - Numeric. Defocus in diopters for each wavelength
%
% Outputs:
%    otf        - Optical transfer function (actually, this is the MTF,
%                 just a set of scale factors. We assume there is no
%                 frequency-dependent phase shift.
%    sampleSFmm - Numeric. Sample spatial frequency in cyc/millimeters
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.

p = opticsGet(optics, 'pupil radius', 'm');
D0 = opticsGet(optics, 'diopters', 'm');

% Converts the defocus in diopters to the Hopkins w20 parameter for a given
% pupil radius in meters, defocus (D, diopters), and dioptric power (D0).
% The explanation for this formula is in Marimont and Wandell, Appendix C:
% Converting from w20 to Defocus in diopters
w20 = (p ^ 2 / 2) * (D0 .* D) ./ (D0 + D);
% plot(wave, w20); 

% Re-write so we can get sampleSF in cycles/mm directly without these two
% extra steps.
c = opticsGet(optics, 'deg per dist', 'm');
% 1 / (atand(1) * (1 / D0));  %  deg per meter (rad/meter)

% The units are: 
% cycles/meter = (cycles/deg) * (deg/meter) 
cSF = sampleSF * c;

% The formulae in the opticsDefocusedMTF appears to have a problem handling
% the SF=0 value. At SF=0 it uses the classic diffraction formula and at
% other values it uses the formula from Marimont and Wandell. THat formula
% seems to be off by a small scale factor that we don't understand. By
% doing this, we get a smooth OTF that doesn't have a value of 1 at DC. In
% the code we force a DC value of 1 - but that is a hack. We should figure
% out what's up with the formula. Also remember that the paper by Subbaro
% claims that the scale factor on the formula is wrong. So there's two of
% out there.
% If we have SF=0, we replace it with a very small number.
ii = (cSF == 0);
cSF(ii) = min(cSF(~ii)) * 1e-12;

% Note: When D0 = 60, as for human, the number is:
%    c = 3434.07;
% This logic is repeated in the humanCore routine

lambda = opticsGet(optics, 'wave', 'm');     % Wavelength in meters
s = zeros(length(lambda), length(sampleSF));
alpha = zeros(size(s));
otf = zeros(size(s));

for ii = 1:length(lambda)
    % We should probably convert sampleSF to sampleSFmm above, and then get
    % rid of the 'c' parameter.
    %
    % Appendix B from Marimont and Wandell
    % Compute the reduced spatial frequency (0, 2)
    % m * (m/m) * cy/m  - Dimensionless in the end
    s(ii, :) = (lambda(ii) / (D0 * p)) * cSF; 

    % Methods: Marimont and Wandell
    % Related to the defocus specified by w20, which in turn depends on p, 
    % D and D0.
    alpha(ii, :) = (4 * pi ./ (lambda(ii))) .* w20(ii) .* abs(s(ii, :));

    % We put the vector of sample SF into this array.
    % Then we interpolate to the full 2D array outside of this loop.
    otf(ii, :) = opticsDefocusedMTF(s(ii, :), abs(alpha(ii, :)));

end

% Some parameters are out of range and yield complex values. We force them
% to 0 here. This is done implicitly for the diffraction limited case by
% using the incoherent cutoff frequency.

% Complex values to zero.

otf(l) = 0;

% Convert to cyc/mm, which is used in opticsGet/Set
% We convert (1 / D0) * 1000 to make it in millimeters, rather than meters.
degPerMillimeter = (1 / (tand(1) * (1 / D0) * 1000));
