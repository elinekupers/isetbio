function [OTF2D, fSupport] = customOTF(oi, fSupport, wavelength, units)
% Interpolate optics OTF for shift-invariant calculation in optical image
%
% Syntax:
%   [OTF2D, fSupport] = customOTF(oi, [fSupport], [wavelength], [units])
%
% Description:
%    In the shift-invariant optics model, custom data are stored in the
%    optics.OTF slot. This routine reads the otf data and interpolates them
%    to the fSupport and wavelength of the optical image structure or
%    optics structure.
%
%    The returned OTF is normalized so that all energy is transmitted
%    (i.e., the DC value is 1). This is done by normalizing the peak value
%    to one. If we ever have a case when the peak is other than the DC, we
%    have a problem with energy conservation - where did the photons go?
%
%    The units for the frequency support are cycles/millimeters. 
%    Perhaps we should add a 'units' input argument here. 
%
% Inputs:
%    oi         - Struct. An optical image structure
%    fSupport   - (Optional) Frequency support. Default retrieves from oi
%    wavelength - (Optional) Vector. Wavelengths. Default retrieves from oi
%    units      - (Optional) String. OTF units. Default millimeter ('mm')
%
% Outputs:
%    OTF2D      - Two-dimensional OTF
%    fSupport   - Frequency support.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.

%                   interpolation with ifftshif, in the branch that loops
%                   over wavelength. ifftshift is what we want here, and
%                   indeed that was correctly used in the branch that
%                   didn't loop over wavelength.

    % Not entirely clear we need to interpolate in this case, as the

    % Do interpolation, use fftshift/ifftshift to take care of DC
    % positions. The reason we have to do this is that the frequency
    % support is represented with DC in the center, while the OTF is stored
    % with DC at (1, 1). That is, the frequency support in the optics
    % object matches the OTF only after application of fftshift.
    %
    % The 0 as the last argument of the interp2 call is the value used for
    % extrapolation. Putting this here prevents NaNs should the requested
    % support exceed the input range
