function oi = opticsOTF(oi, scene)
% Apply the opticalImage OTF to the photon data
%
%Syntax:
%   oi = opticsOTF(oi, scene);
%
% Description:
%    The optical transform function (OTF) associated with the optics in the
%    OI is calculated and applied to the scene data. This function is
%    called for shift-invariant and diffraction-limited models. It is not
%    called for the ray trace approach.
%
%    The spatial (frequency) support of the OTF is computed from the OI
%    information.
%
%    The OTF data are not stored or returned. The OTF can be quite large.
%    It represents every spatial frequency in every waveband. So we compute
%    the OTF and apply it on the fly, without ever representing the whole
%    OTF (support and wavelength).
%
%    The programming issues concerning using Matlab to apply the OTF to the
%    image (rather than convolution in the space domain) are explained both
%    here and in the script s_FFTinMatlab.
%
%    In the future, we may permit saving the OTF in the OI structure by
%    setting the otfSaveFlag to true (1). At present, that flag is not
%    implemented. But computers seem to be getting bigger and faster.
%
% Inputs:
%    oi    - Struct. An optical image structure.
%    scene - (Optional) Struct. A scene structure. Default uses vcGetObject
%            to retrieve an existing scene structure.
%
% Outputs:
%    oi    - Struct. The modified optical image structure.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.
%
% Notes:
%    * TODO: Implement otfSaveFlag

%                   Remove examples from helper functions in this file.
%                   They can't work because you can't call those helper
%                   functions from outside of the top level function.

% Examples:
%{

%}

if notDefined('oi'), error('Optical image required.'); end
if notDefined('scene'), scene = vcGetObject('scene'); end

function oi = oiApplyOTF(oi, scene, unit)
% Calculate and apply the otf waveband by waveband
%
% Syntax:
%   oi = oiApplyOTF(oi, method, unit);
%
% Description:
%    We calculate the OTF every time, never saving it, because it can take
%    up a lot of space and is not that hard to calculate. Also, any change
%    to the optics properties would make us recompute the OTF, and keeping
%    things synchronized can be error prone.
%
% Inputs:
%    oi    - Struct. An optical image structure.
%    scene - Struct. A scene structure.
%    unit  - (Optional) String. A string describing what units to use.
%            Default is 'cyclesPerDegree'.
%
% Outputs:
%    oi    - Struct. The modified optical image structure.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.

% See s_FFTinMatlab to understand the logic of the operations here. We used
% to do this one wavelength at a time. But this could cause dynamic range
% problems for ieCompressData. So, for now we are experimenting with
% filtering one at a time but stuffing the whole data set in at once.

% Get the current data set. It has the right size. We over-write it below.

    % img = oiGet(oi, 'photons', wave(ii));

    % figure(1);
    % imagesc(img);
    % colormap(gray);

    % For diffraction limited we calculate the OTF. For other optics models
    % we look up the stored OTF. Remember, DC is in the (1, 1) position.
    otf = otfM(:, :, ii);
    % vcNewGraphWin;

    % otf(1, 1)

    % Put the image center in (1, 1) and take the transform.
    imgFFT = fft2(fftshift(img));

    % Multiply the transformed otf and the image.
    % Then invert and put the image center in  the center of the matrix
    filteredIMG = abs(ifftshift(ifft2(otf .* imgFFT)));
    
    % Sometimes we had  annoying complex values left after this filtering.
    % We got rid of it by an abs() operator. It should never be there. But
    % we think it arises because of rounding error. We haven't seen this in
    % years, however.
